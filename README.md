## Overview
I'm doing freeCodeCamp challenges and this is part of the backend. In this challenge we were asked to do the following:

User stories:

1) I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

2) If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.

3) When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
